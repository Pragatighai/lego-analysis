# LEGO Amazon Analysis

This project is a **data analysis of LEGO products on Amazon**, designed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization. The notebook is beginner-friendly but also provides useful insights and charts for presentations.

---

## **Project Overview**

The main notebook `LEGO_Amazon_Analysis.ipynb`:

- Loads datasets (`geoMap.csv` and `toy-products-on-amazon-metadata.json`)  
- Performs data cleaning (handling missing values, converting price to numeric, etc.)  
- Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on product and sales data  
- Generates charts and tables summarizing trends and customer reviews  
- Saves images for use in presentations

The analysis is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates data handling, visualization, and basic insights extraction.
